# Sealed-core

## Modular stack wiring

This repository uses a local-only modular stack:

- `sealed_core.py` — core ticketing/storage module imported by other components.
- `gatekeeper_v2_2.py` — authenticated local policy wrapper over `SealedCore`.
- `sealed_snapshot.py` — small snapshot front door that imports `SealedCore`.

## Required environment variables

- `SEALED_OWNER_SECRET` (required): owner secret used by `SealedCore` key derivation.
- `SEALED_PRINCIPALS_JSON` (required for `gatekeeper_v2_2.py`): JSON mapping
  principal IDs to `{role, secret, scope_id}` objects.

Example:

```bash
export SEALED_OWNER_SECRET='replace-with-a-long-random-secret'
export SEALED_PRINCIPALS_JSON='{
  "owner-local": {
    "role": "OWNER",
    "secret": "replace-with-a-long-random-principal-secret",
    "scope_id": "owner"
  }
}'
```

## Notes

- No network listener is required; imports are local Python module calls.
- Vault methods referenced by Gatekeeper/snapshot are declared on `SealedCore` but
  require the full SEALED Core v2.2 implementation.
